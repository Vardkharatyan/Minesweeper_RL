Minesweeper Environment 


Minesweeper is a partially observable, grid-based environment where an agent interacts with a minefield by revealing tiles while avoiding hidden mines. The goal is to uncover all non-mine tiles while strategically marking the mines.The main goal is to open all cells, except for the ones containing mines.

 

self.action_space = spaces.Discrete(ROWS * COLS)

self.observation_space = spaces.Box(low=-1, high=9, shape=(ROWS, COLS), dtype=np.int32)

RL terms

State-The current state of the game board, which includes revealed and hidden tiles, flagged mines, and numbers indicating nearby mines.

Action-The feedback received based on the actionâ€”uncovering an empty tile gives a neutral or positive reward, while hitting a mine results in a negative reward.

Reward-The move taken by the player (or agent), such as clicking on a tile to reveal it or flagging a suspected mine.
